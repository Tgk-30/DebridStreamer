# Docker Server Setup

Use Docker when DebridStreamer should run on a NAS, home server, Raspberry Pi,
VPS, or other always-on device.

## Image

CI publishes multi-arch images to GHCR for:

- `linux/amd64`
- `linux/arm64`

```text
ghcr.io/tgk-30/debridstreamer:latest
```

Tags are created from `main` and Git tags by `.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`.

## Quick Start

```sh
cd deploy/compose
cp .env.example .env
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Paste the generated value into `DS_SERVER_SECRET_KEY` in `.env`.

If the server will be reachable from another device before you create the owner
account, also set `DS_SERVER_SETUP_TOKEN`:

```sh
openssl rand -base64 24
```

Paste that value into `.env`, then start:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:43110
```

Create the owner account on first launch. If `DS_SERVER_SETUP_TOKEN` is set,
paste the same token into the setup form.

## Use Published Image

The default compose file builds locally from the repo. To pull GHCR instead,
replace the service `build:` block with:

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/tgk-30/debridstreamer:latest
```

Then run:

```sh
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## Persistent Data

The container stores SQLite data and the generated server key under `/data`.
The compose file mounts that path as `debridstreamer-data`.

Back up both:

- the SQLite files in `/data`
- `server.key`, unless you provide `DS_SERVER_SECRET_KEY`

Without the same secret key, encrypted credentials cannot be decrypted after a
restore.

## Network Access

Recommended private access paths:

- LAN-only: `http://server-ip:43110`
- Tailscale: `http://machine-name:43110`
- Cloudflare Tunnel or reverse proxy: terminate HTTPS before forwarding to
  `43110`

When exposing through HTTPS, set:

```env
DS_SERVER_COOKIE_SECURE=true
DS_SERVER_TRUST_PROXY=true
```

For an internet-facing deployment, start the included hardened Caddy profile:

```sh
cd deploy/compose
cp .env.example .env
# Set YAWF_DOMAIN and DS_SERVER_SECRET_KEY.
docker compose -f docker-compose.caddy.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.caddy.yml logs debridstreamer
```

Caddy obtains and renews HTTPS certificates, and this profile does not publish
port `43110`. The log command shows the one-time setup token on a fresh server.
See [`deploy/compose/README.md`](../deploy/compose/README.md) for all public-mode
security settings.

When Cloudflare Access protects the site, add a bypass policy only for
`/api/external-stream/*`. External media players cannot send Access browser
cookies. This path still requires YAWF Stream's short-lived, stream-scoped
capability and remains subject to profile and session revocation.

Use DebridStreamer profiles even when Cloudflare Access or Tailscale protects
the outer network. Those layers are additional protection, not a replacement for
per-profile history, credentials, and session boundaries.

## Updates

For local builds:

```sh
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

For GHCR images:

```sh
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```
